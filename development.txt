Development plan

* Step 1 — Port Vec2, Mat22, Rotation OK

80% of Box2D Lite relies on correct math.

* Step 2 — Port Body OK

* Step 3 — Port collision shapes & broadphase 

Start with circles and boxes.

* Step 4 — Port contact generation OK

This step requires careful translation.

* Step 5 — Port impulse solver OK

Most bugs will happen here—test repeatedly.

* Step 6 — Write a visual test harness

A tiny HTML Canvas viewer to see how objects move.

* Step 7 - Add integration tests

* Step 8 - Optimize collision detection In progress

* Step 9 - Implement contact caching Already implemented
